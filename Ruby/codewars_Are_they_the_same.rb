# 6 kyu Are they the "same"?

# Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (compSame(a, b) in Clojure) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities. "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

# a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] 
# b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]

# I think my solution beats the best practice
def comp(array1, array2)
  array1 && array2 ? array1.sort.map(&:abs2) == array2.sort : false
end
